Title :  Prowler 


Walking through the city
Looking oh-so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing
All their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way

Well... you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide
What you seeing, girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing, girl!

Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around

Got me feeling myself and reeling
Got me talking but nothing's with me
Got me feeling myself and reeling around

Walking through the city

Got me talking but feel like walking around
Title :  Sanctuary 


Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before but I know how it feels

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law

I met up with a stranger last night to keep me alive
He spends all his money on gambling and guns to survive

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law

So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight
Tonight

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law

Oh, I can laugh at the wind (ha ha ha!)
I can howl at the rain (Ow!)
Down in the canyon
Or out on the plains

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law

So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight
Tonight
Love me tonight
Title :  Remember Tomorrow 


Unchain the colours, before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return, from out of the... Oh!

Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, but this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the... Sky!

Unchain the colours, before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the... (Fire!)
Title :  Running Free 


Just sixteen, a pickup truck
Out of money, out of luck
I've got nowhere to call my own
Hit the gas, and here I go

I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free, yeah
Oh, I'm running free

I spent the night in an L.A. jail
And listened to the sirens wail
But they ain't got a thing on me
I'm running wild, I'm running free

I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free, yeah
Oh, I'm running free

Get out of my way, hey

I'm running free, yeah

I'm running free, yeah
Oh, I'm running free

Pulled her at the Bottle Top
Whiskey, dancing, disco hop
Now all the boys are after me
And that's the way it's gonna be, yeah!

I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free, yeah
Oh, I'm running free

Title :  Phantom Of The Opera 


I've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding
And hiding behind that false mask
You know, and I know that you ain't got long now to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past

You're standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Now, I know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call

Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away, yeah
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way, yeah

I'm running and hiding in my dreams, you're always there
You're the Phantom of the Opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul, it just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair

Torture me back at your lair
Title :  Strange World 


The only place where you can dream
Living here is not what it seems
Ship of white light in the sky
Nobody there to reason why
Here I am, I'm not really there
Smiling faces ever so rare
Let's walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the place
Oh

Stalks of light come from the ground
When I cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held
I'm happy in my new strange world
Shades of green grasses twine
Girls drinking plasma wine
A look at love, a dream unfolds
Living here, you'll never grow old

Oh, baby
Don't you hear me call?
Ooh
Title :  Charlotte The Harlot 


Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?

Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love

Taking so many men to your room
Don't you feel no remorse?
You charge them a "fiver", it's only for starters
And ten for the main course
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago
Don't you care who you let in?
And don't you know you're breaking the law
With the service you're giving?

Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love

Oh, babe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There was a time when you left me standing there
Picking up pieces of love off the floor
Well, Charlotte, you left me alone in there
To make your ends as a bloody whore
Well, Charlotte, you told me you'd love me true
Picking up pieces of love, yesterday
Well, Charlotte, your drawers are off-color, too, oh
'Cause you're making love all day
Aw, 'cause you're making
Ooh
Ooh yeah
Aw, 'cause you're making

Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?

Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love

Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares

See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought

Oh well, wherever, wherever you are

See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead

Title :  Wrathchild 


I was born into a scene of angriness and greed
Dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen, my dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be
And now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around

'Cause I'm a wrathchild
I'm a wrathchild
Ah, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah

Oh... yeah!

Say it doesn't matter, ain't nothin' gonna alter
The course of my destination
I know I've got to find some serious piece of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazy
But now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around

'Cause I'm a wrathchild
Well, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah

Yeah!
Title :  Murders In The Rue Morgue 


I remember it as plain as day
Although it happened in the dark of the night
I was strolling through the streets of Paris
And it was cold it was starting to rain
And then I heard a piercing scream
And I rushed to the scene of the crime
But all I found was the butchered remains
Of two girls lay side by side

Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Flee before the killers go free

There's some people coming down the street
At last someone heard my call
Can't understand why they're pointing at me
I never done nothing at all
But I got some blood on my hands
Because everyone's shouting at me
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
And like a fool I started running away

Murder in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Murder in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free?

And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law
All France is looking for me
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
Down the south to Italy

Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm running from the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never coming home

Well, I made it to the border at last
But I can't erase the scene from my mind
Anytime somebody stares at me, well
I just start running blind
Well, I'm moving through the shadows at night
Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be looking for me
'Cause I know I show the signs of

Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm running from the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Running from the arms of the law

Murders in the Rue Morgue
Running from the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free?

It took so long and I'm getting so tired
I'm running out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died
If I could go to somebody for help
To get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that inside my mind
Well, I've got to say I've done it before

Murders in the Rue Morgue
They're never gonna find me
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never going home
Title :  Another Life 


As I lay here lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is, I want to know
Please, won't you tell me? It's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away
But I'm so tired of living
I might as well end today

Title :  Innocent Exile 


My life is so empty, nothing to live for
My mind is all confusion, 'cause I defied the law
When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran
I never had no trouble before this all began

My life is so empty, nothing to live for

I'm lost and tired and I just don't know. Yeah
They say I killed a woman, they know it isn't true
They're just trying to frame me, and all because of you. Yeah
Title :  Killers 


Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Ow! Yeah!
Oh yeah!
Ow! Yeah!
Ooh, look out!

You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs

My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me

I can see what a life's meant to be
And you'll never know how I came to foresee, see, see

My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike

The death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!
I have found you, and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?!
Oh yeah, I've done it again!
Yeah!

You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs
Oh look out, I'm coming for you!
Aha ha ha ha!

Oh! Oh!
Title :  Prodigal Son 


Listen to me, Lamia, listen to what I've got to say
I've got these feelings and they won't go away
I've got these fears inside that'll bring me to my knees
Oh, help me, Lamia, or I'm sure I'll die, oh, please

I feel unsettled, now I know that I've done wrong
I've messed around with mystic things and magic for far too long
I feel I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me
The devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be

I'm on my knees, oh, help me, please
I'm on my knees, help me please

Oh, Lamia, please try to help me
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
Lamia, I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad
The devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
Oh

Oh, Lamia, please try to help me
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
Lamia, I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad
The devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
Oh
Title :  Purgatory 


Thinking of an age old dream
Places I have never seen
Fantasies lived times before
I split my brain, melt through the floor
Over clouds my mind will fly
Forever now I can't think why
My body tries to leave my soul
Is it me, I just don't know
Memories rising from the past
The future's shadow's overcast
Something's clutching at my head
Through the darkness, I'll be led

Oh, another time, another place
Oh, another smile on another face
When you see me floating up beside you
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you
Please take me away, take me away, so far away
Please take me away, take me away, so far away
Please take me away, take me away, so far away, hey!

Title :  Twilight Zone 


She lays in bed at night and that is when I make my call
But when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all
Because, you see, I can't take no shape or form
It's been three long years since I've been gone

I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry
I'll never know the reason why I had to go
Oh, oh, I'm crying
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me
Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?
Ah can't you see me?

I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me
I feel tempted to bring her over to see just what it's
Like to be hanging on the other side
I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died

I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone
Because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone
Oh, oh, I'm crying
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me
Oh, oh, oh, can't you hear me?
Ah can't you see me?

Title :  Invaders 


Longboats have been sighted
And the evidence of war has begun
Many Nordic fighting men
Their swords and shields all gleam in the sun
Call to arms defend yourselves
Get ready to stand and fight for your lives
Judgement day has come around
So be prepared – don't run – stand your ground

They're coming in from the sea
They've come the enemy
Beneath the blazing sun
The battle has to be won
Invaders... Pillaging!
Invaders... Looting!

Set ablaze the campfires and alert the other men from inland
Warning must be given and there's not enough men here for a stand
The Vikings are too many, much too powerful to take on our own
We must have reinforcements, we cannot fight this battle alone

They're coming over the hill
They've come to attack
They're coming in for the kill
There's no turning back
Invaders... Fighting!
Invaders... Marauding!

Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground
Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around
The smell of death and burning flesh the battle-weary fight to the end
The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen

You'd better scatter and run
The battle's lost and not won
You'd better get away
To fight another day
Invaders... Raping!
Invaders... Plundering!

He's walking like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home

Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned

He's walking like a dead man
If he had lived he would've crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought, "Oblivion? Well, it beckons us all."

Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned

Now it's burning his hands, he's turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face, screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on the ground, what did we learn?

Oh-o-o-o-o-ooh
Oh-o-o-o-o-ooh

You're children of the Damned
Your back's against the wall
You turn into the light
You're burning in the night
You're children of the Damned
Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
You'll burn again tonight
Children of the Damned

We want information, information, information
Who are you?
The new number 2
Who is number 1?
You are number 6
I am not a number, I am a free man!

I'm on the run, I kill to eat
I'm starving now, feelin' dead on my feet
Goin' all the way, I'm nature's beast
Do what I want and do as I please

Run, fight to breathe, it's tough
Now you see me, now you don't
Break the walls, I'm comin' out

Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going – out!

If you kill me, it's self-defense
But if I kill you then I call it vengeance
Spit in your eye, I will defy
You'll be afraid of when I call out your name

Run, fight to breathe, it's gonna be tough
Now you see me and now you don't
Break the walls, I'm comin' out

Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going

I'm not a number, I'm a free man
Live my life where I want to
You'd better scratch me from your black book
'Cause I'll run rings around you

Title :  22 Acacia Avenue 


If you're feeling down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go
22 Acacia Avenue
Meet a lady that I know
So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybody's got their vice

If you're waiting for a long time
For the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
And you might even get it free
So any time you're down the East End
Don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can know

Charlotte can't you get out from all this madness?
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting disease
Some day when you're reach the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show, any more

22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight

Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
Don't you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?
Sometimes when you're strolling down the avenue
The way you walk it makes men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you

22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight

Beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want?

You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning?
Your life's good don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags, you're coming with me
Title :  The Number Of The Beast 


Woe to you, o'er Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty six

I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams, were they
Reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cause in my dreams, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair

Yeah!

The night was black, was no use holding back
Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of hell?

666 the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done

666 the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes

666 the number of the beast
666 the one for you and me

I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course
Title :  Run To The Hills 


White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need

We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for Cree
Oh will we ever be set free?

Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards attack

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Injuns are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Title :  Gangland 


Shadows may hide you but also may be your grave
You're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
You pray for the daylight to save you for a while
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile

Dead men, tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men, tell no tales
Gangland, where the jail birds die

Face at the window leers into your own
But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones
How long can you hide? How long till they come?
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive

Once you were glad to be free for a while
The air tasted good and the world was your friend
Then came the day when the hard times began
Now you're alone but alive for how long?

Dead men, tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men, tell no tales
Gangland, where the jail birds die

A knife at your throat another body on the pile
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain
Death on the streets or a blackened out jail

Dead men, tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men, tell no tales
Gangland, where the jail birds die

Dead men, gangland
Murder, gangland
Tell no tales
Title :  Total Eclipse 


Cold as steel, the darkness waits its hour will come
A cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun
Mother nature's black revenge on those who wasted her life
War babies in the garden of Eden shall turn our ashes to ice

Sunrise has gone
Freezing up the fires
Sunrise has gone
Numbing our desires
Sunrise has gone
Sunrise has gone

Around the world the people stop with terror stricken eyes
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas, there's nowhere left to run
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane

Sunrise has gone
Freezing up the fires
Sunrise has gone
Numbing our desires

Around the world the nations wait
For some wise word from their leading light
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools
"Is this the end?" the millions cried
Clutching their riches as they died
Those who survive must weather the storm

Gone are the days when man looked down
They've taken away his sacred crown
To be so free, it took so long
It's not journey's end, it's just begun
Title :  Hallowed Be Thy Name 


I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak

Tears fall but why am I crying?
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell "God be with you"
If there's a God why has He let me go?

As I walk my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth

When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion

Yeah, yeah, yeah... Hallowed be Thy name
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Hallowed be Thy name
Yeah
Title :  Where Eagles Dare 


It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near, the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky

The blizzard goes on, but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare

Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow

Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare

They're closing in, the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable car's the only way in
It's really impossible to climb

They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day

The panicking cries, the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete, they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest

They dared to go, where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare
Title :  Revelations 


"O God of Earth and altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away our pride"
[G.K. Chesterton: English Hymnal]

Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know
The secret of the hanged man, the smile on his lips

The light of the blind - you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see

She came to me with a serpent's kiss
As the eye of the sun rose on her lips
Moonlight catches silver tears that I cry
So we lay in a black embrace
And the seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn

The light of the blind - you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see

Go

Bind all of us together
Ablaze with hope and free
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see
The time has come to close your eyes
Still the wind and rain
For the one who will be king
The watcher in the ring
It is you
It is you
It is you
Title :  Flight Of Icarus 


As the sun breaks above the ground
An old man stands on the hill
As the ground warms to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still

His eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gaze

Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
"In the name of God, my father, I fly"

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes, to ashes his grave

Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun

Fly, on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly

Fly as high as the sun
Title :  Die With Your Boots On 


Yeah, another prophet of disaster
Who says this ship is lost
Another prophet of disaster
Leaving you to count the cost

Taunting us with visions
Afflicting us with fear
Predicting war for millions
In the hope that one appears

Title :  The Trooper 


You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Title :  Still Life 


[Backwards:]
What ho said the t'ing with the three bonce, don't meddle with things you don't understand

Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me

Oh I've never felt so strange
But I'm not going insane

I've no doubt that you think I'm off of my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do

Oh they drain my strength away
Oh they're asking me to stay

Nightmares. Spirits calling me
Nightmares. They won't leave me be

All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool

Now I feel they are so near
I begin to see them clear

Nightmares. Coming all the time
Nightmares. Will give me peace of mind

Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into that pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too

Oh we'll drown together
It will be forever

Nightmares. Forever calling me
Nightmares. Now we rest in peace
Title :  Quest For Fire 


In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam

Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
To save the power of warmth and light

Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man

And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone

So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of light and heat

Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man

Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man

Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man
Title :  Sun And Steel 


Well, you killed your first man at 13
Killer instinct, Animal supreme
By 16 you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior, you took it as your right

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Through earth and water, fire and wind
You came at last – nothing was the end
Make a cut by fire and stones
Take you and your blade and break you both
In two – break you both in two

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel rolling on and on

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal

Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Title :  To Tame A Land 


He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow

He rules the sandworms and the Fremen
In a land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow

He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
In the land called planet Dune

Body water is your life
And without it that you would die
In the desert the planet Dune

Without a still suit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis

It is a land that's rich in spice
The sand riders and the 'mice'
That they call the 'Muad' Dib'

He is the Kwizatz Haderach
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar

He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars

The time will come for him
To lay claim his crown
And then the foe
Yes, they'll be cut down

You'll see he'll be
The best that there's been
Messiah supreme
True leader of men

And when the time
For judgement's at hand
Don't fret he's strong
He'll make a stand

Against evil the fire
That spreads through the land
He has the power
To make it all end
Title :  Aces High 


There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack

Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks
There's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late

Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving
Going in again
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving

Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high

Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again

Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109s out of the sun
Ascending and turning our Spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving
Going in again
Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving

Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high
Title :  2 Minutes To Midnight 


Kill for gain or shoot to maim
But we don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?

2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb

The blind men shout "Let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers."
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast ... yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore

2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb

The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore

2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb

Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night

Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night
Title :  Flash Of The Blade 


As a young boy chasing dragons
With your wooden sword so mighty
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast
Times change very quickly, and you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet

You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour

The smell of resined leather, the steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew to fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the screams of evil men

You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour

You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
Title :  The Duellists 


He threw down a glove, you made the mistake
Of picking it up, now you're gone
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords
The choice of weapons is done
He'll tear you apart, as soon as you start
You know you don't have a chance

Oh, oh, fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for the pleasure
Oh, oh, fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for your life

Ready to start, the duel begins
The best man wins in the end
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late
A cut to the chest and you're down
Seeing the stain, then feeling the pain
Feeling the sweat on your brow

Oh, oh, fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for the pleasure
Oh, oh, fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for your life

The fighting resumes, a silence looms
The swordsmen move against each other
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow
A stab to the heart and you're down
The Angel of Death hears your last breath
Meanwhile, the reaper looks on

Oh, oh, fought for the honour
Fought for the splendour
Fought for the pleasure
Oh, oh, fought for the honour
Fought for the splendour
Fought to the death
Title :  Back In The Village 


Turn the spotlights on the people
Switch the dial and eat the worm
Take your chances, kill the engine
Drop your bombs and let it burn

White flags shot to ribbons
The truce is black and burned
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables overturned

Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again

Throwing dice now, rolling loaded
I see sixes all the way
In a black hole, and I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away

Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn

Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again

No breaks on the inside
Paper cats and burning barns
There's a fox among the chickens
And a killer in the hounds

Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn

Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again

But still, we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter than before
I don't have a number, I'm a name!

Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again

Back in the village
I'm back in the village
I'm back in the village again

Into the Abyss I'll fall, the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night, watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris, risen again

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death

When I was living this lie, fear was my game
People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and
Red wine for the one to succeed me
For He is a man and a God
And He will die too

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death

Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man, god preserved
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell
I'll strike from the grave

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death

Slave to the Power of Death
Slave to the Power of Death
Title :  Rime Of The Ancient Mariner 


Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea

And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings

And the ship sails on, back to the north
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime

Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse, a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung

And the curse goes on and on and on and on and on at sea
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me

"Day after day, day after day
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink"

"There," calls the mariner, "There comes a ship o'er the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?"

See... onward she comes
Onward she nears, out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but there's two

Death and she life in death
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now
Then... crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She... she, life in death
She lets him live, her chosen one

"One after one by the star dogged moon
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump
They dropped down one by one."

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he

And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too

Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes

And revenge still is sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit
Penance of life will fall onto him

And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins

The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on and on and on
Title :  Caught Somewhere In Time 


If you had the time to lose
An open mind and time to choose
Would you care to take a look
Or can you read me like a book?

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Can I tempt you, come with me
Be Devil may care, fulfill your dream
If I said I'd take you there
Would you go, would you be scared?

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Don't be afraid, you're safe with me
Safe as any soul can be honestly
Just let yourself go

Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh

Like a wolf in sheep's clothing
You try to hide your deepest sins
Of all the things that you've done wrong
And I know where you belong

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Make you an offer you can't refuse
You've only got your soul to lose
Eternally... let yourself go!

Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught now in two minds!
Title :  Wasted Years 


From the coast of gold across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on far and wide
But now it seems
I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else

I close my eyes, and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is
You never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be 'til my dying day

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years

Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years
Title :  Sea Of Madness 


Out in the street somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh – my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh – my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave

Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness

Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling
Out in the dark there burns a dream
You got to hope when you are falling
To find the world that you have seen
Oh – my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh – my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave

Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness

It's madness
The sun don't shine
On the sea of madness
There ain't no wind to fill your sails
Madness when all you see can only bring you sadness
On towards the sea we go

Out in the night somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh – my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh – my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave

Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness
Of madness
Of madness
Of madness
Of madness
Of madness
Of madness
Title :  Heaven Can Wait 


Can't understand what is happening to me
This isn't real, this is only a dream
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this way before
I'm looking down on my body below
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream
Is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?

I can't believe that really my time has come
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away

Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day

I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe
'Cause I've no fear of dying, I'll go when I'm good and ready
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed
At all of the people standing there in front of me
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare

Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day

Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side
To see the truth, the path for you is decided

Oh oh

My body tingles, I feel so strange
I feel so tired, I feel so drained
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again
Is this in limbo or Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well
I can't accept my soul will drift forever
I feel myself floating back down to Earth
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
Title :  The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner 


Tough of the track with the wind
And the rain that's beating down on your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more till the sound is ringing in your head
With every step you tread and every breath you take

Determination makes you run, never stop
Gotta win, gotta run till you drop
Keep the pace, hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer
You're over halfway there
But the miles, they never seem to end
As if you're in a dream, not getting anywhere
It seems so futile

Run, on and on
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner

I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at all costs
I've got to keep going, be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on

Run over stiles, across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer
But do you want the glory that goes?
You reach the final stretch, ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile

Run, on and on
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner
Run, on and on
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner
Title :  Stranger In A Strange Land 


Was many years ago that I left home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem
No brave new world, no brave new world
No brave new world, no brave new world

Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me
Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no trace

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped into this prison, yea
Lost and far from home

One hundred years have gone and men again
They came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying where it fell on that day
Preserved in time for all to see
No brave new world, no brave new world
Lost in this place, and leave no trace

What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

Stranger in a strange land
Title :  Deja-Vu 


When you see familiar faces
But you don't remember where they're from
Could you be wrong?

When you've been particular places
That you know you've never been before
Can you be sure?

'Cause you know this has happened before
And you know that this moment in time is for real
And you know when you feel deja-vu

Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before

Ever had a conversation
That you realise you've had before?
Isn't it strange?

Have you ever talked to someone
And you feel you know what's coming next?
It feels pre-arranged

'Cause you know that you've heard it before
And you feel that this moment in time is surreal
'Cause you know when you feel deja-vu

Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Title :  Alexander The Great 


"My son, ask for thyself another kingdom
For that which I leave is too small for thee"
[King Philip of Macedonia – 339 B.C.]

Near to the east
In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend, his name was Alexander

At the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegean Sea
In 334 B.C
He utterly beat the armies of Persia

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a legend amongst mortal men

King Darius the third
Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell
To the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria

By the Tigris river
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis, the capital of Persia

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a god amongst mortal men

A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia

Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on, marching on

The battle-weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in Babylon
Title :  Moonchild 


Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires

I am he, the bornless one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devil's own, Lucifer's my name

Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal

I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones, I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death

Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight

The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die

One more dies, and one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you, young man
But I see you damned in endless night

Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight
Title :  Infinite Dreams 


Infinite dreams, I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again

Someone chasing, I cannot move
Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end and will I transcend?
Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
It's getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep

Even though it's reached new heights
I'd rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder, makes me think
There's more to this, I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest, almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?

Can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist?
Well me, I'm neither
Wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there to have the proof?
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end?
In Heaven or in Hell?

Help me
Help me to find my true self without seeing the future
Save me
Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams

There's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance, another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again and again
Title :  Can I Play With Madness? 


Can I play with madness?

Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place

Can I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha)
He said:
Can I play with madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to see
Said you're too blind to see

I screamed aloud to the old man
I said "Don't lie, don't say you don't know"
I say "You'll pay for this mischief
In this world or the next"
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said "You wanna know the truth son?
Lord, I'll tell you the truth
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire"

Title :  The Evil That Men Do 


Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her, if I could only see her now

Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on

Circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you, some day I may return
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn

Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
You know, you know

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on

Title :  Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son 


Here they stand, brothers them all
All the sons, divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one

Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds

Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son

Then they watch the progress he makes
The Good and the Evil, which path will he take?
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers, before it's too late

Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son

Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman, the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be done
Title :  The Prophecy 


Now that I know that the right time has come
My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster, it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed

Why won't you listen to me?
Is it so hard to understand?
That I am the real seventh son
Your life or death on me depends

Suffering and pain, impending disaster
Souls crying, the Devil's laughter
I heard the cry of the seven whistlers
Lucifer smiles, looks on and awaits

I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate, your fortune's in my vision
Heed what I say and you'll see what will be
Please listen to me

Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame on to me
They feel I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment it stays with me?
Knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future, I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed?

Purgatory beckons, souls lost forever
Life after death or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
Now Lucifer laughs, Hell awaits

I had their lives in my hands
Their fate, their fortunes in my vision
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now it's too late
Title :  The Clairvoyant 


Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls?
Is this a dream or is it now?
Is this a vision or normality I see before my eyes?

I wonder why, I wonder how
That it seems that the power's getting stronger every day
I feel a strength an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying

Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right in through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
...and be reborn again?
Title :  Only The Good Die Young 


The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed

Time, it waits for no man
My future it is revealed
Time, it waits for no man
My fate is sealed

If I cancel tomorrow, the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of your prophets, I mock your morality plays

The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an endgame, one more stalemate

Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us and look through our eyes?

Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin, does it measure up to your lust?

So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So until the next time
Have a good sin

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires
Title :  Tailgunner 


Trace your way back fifty years
To the glow of Dresden, blood and tears
In the black above by the cruel searchlight
Men will die and men will fight, yeah

Who shot who and who fired first?
Dripping death to whet the bloodlust
No radar lock on, skin and bone
The bomber boys are going home

Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner

Nail that Fokker, kill that son
Gonna blow your guts out with my gun
The weather forecast's good for war
Cologne and Frankfurt? Have some more, ha ha ha!

Tail end Charlie in the boiling sky
The Enola Gay was my last try
Now that this Tailgunner's gone
No more bombers, one big bomb, yeah hey, ooh

Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Title :  Holy Smoke 


Believe in me and send no money
I died on the cross, that ain't funny
But my so called friends they're making me a joke
They missed out what I said like I never spoke

They choose what they wanna hear, don't tell a lie
They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die
Saving your soul by taking your money
Flies around shit, bees around honey

Holy smoke, holy smoke
There's plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work making holy smoke, yeah
Making holy smoke

Jimmy Reptile and all his friends
Say they gonna be with you at the end
Burning records, burning books
Holy soldiers, Nazi looks

Crocodile smiles, just wait awhile
Till the TV queen gets her make up clean
I've lived in filth, I've lived in sin
And I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in

Holy smoke, holy smoke
There's plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work making holy smoke, yeah
Holy smoke, smells good

They ain't religious but they ain't no fools
When Noah built his Cadillac, it was cool
Two by two they're still going down
And the satellite circus just left town
I think they're strange and when they're dead
They can have a Lincoln for their bed
Friend of the president, trick of the tail
Now they ain't got a prayer, 100 years in jail

Holy smoke, holy smoke
Plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work making holy smoke. Yeah
Holy smoke
Title :  No Prayer For The Dying 


There are times when I've wondered
And times when I've cried
When my prayers, they were answered
At times when I've lied
But if you asked me a question
Would I tell you the truth?
Now there's something to bet on
You've got nothing to lose, yeah

When I've sat by the window
And gazed at the rain
With an ache in my heart
But never feeling the pain
And if you would tell me
Just what my life means
Walking a long road
Never reaching the end

God, give me the answer to my life
God, give me the answer to my dreams
God, give me the answer to my prayers
God, give me the answer to my being
Title :  Public Enema Number One 


Ah ha!

When it all comes down the line
And the lights, they turn to greed
And you race off with your tyres screaming
Rolling thunder
And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got one last bullet
One way ticket out of here

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

In the cities, in the streets
There's a tension you can feel
The breaking strain is fast approaching
Guns and riots
The politicians gamble
And lie to save their skins
And the press get fed their scapegoats
Public enema number one

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell you
Your children have more brains
Than your drug infested remains
California dreaming as the earth dies screaming

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

Mm, what ho!
Title :  Fates Warning 


Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive?
And some of us are here just so that we'll die?
How come the bullet hits the other guy?
Do we have to try and reason why?

Be it the Devil or be it Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up, you'll know
Not just one power runs the show

Are we the lucky ones saved for another day
Or they the lucky ones who are taken away?
Is it a hand on your shoulder from the Lord above
Or the Devil himself come to give you a shove?

Be it the Devil or be it Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up, you'll know
Not just one power runs the show

A volcano erupts and sweeps a town away
A hurricane devastates the cities in its way
The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind
The worst is yet to come, a Hell to face mankind

Be it the Devil or be it Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up, you'll know
Not just one power runs the show
Title :  The Assassin 


Now the contract's out
They've put the word about
I'm coming after you
It's not the money I make
It's the thrill of the chase
And I'm coming after you
I watch your every move
Study the things you do
And the pattern of your ways
I watch the way you walk
I hear your telephone talk
I want to understand the way you think

Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out

Assassin, assassin
Assassin, assassin
Ha! Ha ha ha

I'm in a cold, cold sweat
I taste the smell of death
I know the moment's getting closer
And as you walk to the light
I feel my hands go tight
Excitement running though my veins
I've got you in my sights
I've got you dead to rights
The trigger's waiting for my finger
I feel adrenaline rush
It's just the final touch
And you can kiss your ass goodbye

Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out

Assassin
Title :  Run Silent Run Deep 


The convoy lights are dead ahead
The merchantmen lay in their bed
The thump of diesels hammer down
In the oily sea, the killing ground
Knuckles white, eyes alight
He slams the hatch on the deadly night
A cunning fox in the chicken's lair
A hound of Hell and the Devil don't care

Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below
Running silent, running deep
Sink into your final sleep

Chill the hearts of fighting men
In open ocean wondering when
The lethal silver fish will fly
This boat will shiver, men will die
A cast of millions, a part to play
Killer, victim, fool for the day?
Obeying an order, men have to die
Us or them, a well-rehearsed lie

Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below
Running silent, running deep
Sink into your final sleep

The lifeboat's shattered, the hull is torn
The tar black smell of burning oil
On the way down to Davy Jones
Every man for himself, you're on your own
The wolf eyes watch the crossfire
Stern tubes ready, aim and fire
They can pin some medal on your chest
Ah, in two more weeks, dead like the rest

Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below
Running silent, running deep
Sink into your final sleep

Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
Title :  Hooks In You 


I got the keys to view at number twenty-two
Behind my green door there's nothing to see
Is that a feature? What kind of creature
Would hang around waiting for a guy like me?
Stone cold sober and sitting in silence
Laid back and looking for sympathy
I like a girl who knows where she's bound
I don't like girls who've been hanging around

Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in

She's tied up, she can't come to the phone
You must have got your wires crossed, she ain't home
Knock on wood, you know I like that sound
She never could keep her feet on the ground

Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you

Oh yeah, yeah yeah

Right on the money, got it wrapped up tight
Got new ideas for the decor tonight
Make this house a preservation zone
Gonna set her in concrete, set her up on her own

Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you
I've got those
Hooks in you
Title :  Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter 


Honey, it's getting close to midnight
And all the myths are still in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow, make no sound
If there's some living to be done
Before your life becomes your tomb
You'd better know that I'm the one
Unchain your back door
Invite me around

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

Let her go!

Honey, it's getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your knees, honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray that I'll be waiting
'Cause you know, you know I'm coming soon

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

So pick up your foolish pride
No going back
Nowhere, no way, no place to hide
Let her go

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
To the slaughter

Bring your daughter
Fetch your daughter
Bring your daughter
Fetch your daughter
Bring your daughter
Fetch your daughter
To the slaughter

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Gonna get you!
Title :  Mother Russia 


Mother Russia, how are you sleeping?
Middle winter cold winds blow
From the trees the snowflakes drifting
Swirling 'round like ghosts in the snow

Mother Russia, poetry majestic
Tells the tale of a great empire
Turning 'round, the old man ponders
Reminiscing an age gone by

Mother Russia, dance of the tsars
Hold up your heads, be proud of what you are
Now it has come, freedom at last
Turning the tides of history and your past

Mother Russia, dance of the tsars
Hold up your heads, remember who you are
Can you release the anger, the grief?
Can you be happy now your people are free?
Title :  Be Quick Or Be Dead 


Covered in sinners and dripping with guilt
Making you money from slime and from filth
Parading your bellies in ivory towers
Investing our lives in your schemes and your powers

You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in Heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in Heaven
The thief in your head

Be quick or be dead
Be quick, quick, quick, quick
Or be dead, dead, dead, dead

See what's ruling all our lives
See who's pulling strings
See what's ruling all our lives
See who pulls the strings
I bet you won't fall on your face
Your belly will hold you in place

The serpent is crawling inside of your ear
He says you must vote for what you want to hear
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're alright
Pull yourself stupid, rob yourself blind

You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in Heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in Heaven
The thief's in your head

Be quick or be dead
Be quick, quick, quick, quick
Or be dead, dead, dead, dead

You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in Heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in Heaven
The thief's in your head

Be quick... or be dead!
Be quick!
Title :  From Here To Eternity 


She fell in love with his greasy machine
She leaned over, wiped his kick start clean
She'd never seen the Beast before
But she left there wanting more, more, more

But when she was walking on down the road
She heard a sound that made her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back
"I'll take you on a ride from here to eternity"

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

She must be having one of her crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
It made her feel like she's on cloud nine
She even thought she heard the engine sigh

But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the Devil's bend
The Beast and Charlotte, they were two of a kind
They'd always take the line from here to eternity

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

Yes, ah, yeah, like ah
Gentlemen, start your engines
Mr. Murray

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

Hell ain't a bad place, come on
Hell is from here to eternity

Title :  Afraid To Shoot Strangers 


Lying awake at night, I wipe the sweat from my brow
But it's not the fear, 'cause I'd rather go now
Trying to visualize the horrors that will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground

When it comes to the time are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time, we'll be ready to die

God, let us go now and finish what's to be done
Thy Kingdom come, thy shall be done on Earth
Trying to justify to ourselves the reasons to go
Should we live and let live? Forget or forgive?

But how can we let them go on this way?
The reign of terror corruption must end
And we know deep down there's no other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers

Afraid
Afraid to shoot strangers!

Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
Title :  Fear Is The Key 


We live our lives in fever
In a choking sweat of fear
In the heat of the night you can feel so much
In the heat of the night I scream, "Don't touch!"

I remember a time when we used and abused
We fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time we thought that passion was free
In the heat of the night... bodies aflame

We live in fever

I hear your secret heartbeat
I can hear your silent cries
The kids have lost their freedom
And nobody cares 'til somebody famous dies

I remember a time when we used and abused
And we fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time we thought that passion was free
In the heat of the night... bodies aflame

We live in fever
We live in fever

Now we live in a world of uncertainty
Fear is the key to what you want to be
You don't get a say the majority gets its way
You're outnumbered by the bastards 'til the day you die
(Ha ha ha ha ha)

I hear your silent heartbeat
I hear your silent cries
Oh your just in lies and lies

The kids have lost their freedom
And nobody cares 'til somebody famous dies
Keep telling lies and lies and lies
Aaaeeee-ha ha hah

I remember the time when we used and abused
Ah, it was just lies
I remember the time we thought that passion was free
And it was just lies and lies and lies

Heat of the night
Aaaaeeeeee

We live in fever
We live in fever!
We live in fever

Now we live in a world of uncertainty
Fear is the key to what you want to be
You don't get a say the majority gets its way
You're outnumbered by the bastards 'til the day you die
Title :  Childhood's End 


I'd sail across the ocean
I'd walk a hundred miles
If I could make it to the end
Oh just to see a smile

You see it in their faces
The sadness in their tears
The desperation and the anger
Madness and the fear

No hope, no life, just pain and fear
No food, no love, just greed is here

Starvation and the hunger
The suffering and the pain
The agonies of all-out war
When will it come again?

The struggle for the power
A tyrant tries again
Just what the hell is going on?
When will it ever end?

No hope, no life, just pain and fear
No food, no love, just greed is here

You see the full moon float
You watch the red sun rise
We take these things for granted
But somewhere someone's dying

Contaminated waters
Pollution and decay
Just waiting for disease to strike
Oh will we learn someday?

No hope, no life, just pain and fear
No food, no love, no seed, childhood's end
Title :  Wasting Love 


Maybe one day I'll be an honest man
Up 'til now I'm doing the best I can
Long roads, long days of sunrise to sunset
Sunrise to sunset

Dream on brothers, while you can
Dream on sisters, I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of time

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night

Dream on brothers, while you can
Dream on sisters, I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of time

Sands are flowing and the lines
Are in your hand
In your eyes I see the hunger and the
Desperate cry that tears the night

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night
Title :  The Fugitive 


On a cold October morning
As frost lay on the ground
Waiting to make my move
I made no sound

Waiting for the mist
To cover all around
I carefully picked my time
Then took the wall

I'm sick and tired of running
The hunger and the pain
A stop to look about
Then off again

Being at the wrong place
And at the wrong time
Suspected of a hit
That was my crime

I am a fugitive
Being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive
But I've got to clear my name
I am a fugitive
Being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive
But I've got to clear my name

Always looking 'round me
Forever looking back
I'll always be a target for attack

Every moving onwards
Always on the run
Waiting for a sight of a loaded gun

I am a fugitive
Being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive
But I've got to clear my name
I am a fugitive
Being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive
But I've got to clear my name

Even if I find them
And get to clear my name
I know that things can never be the same

But if I ever prove
My innocence someday
I've got to get them all to make them pay

I am a fugitive
Being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive
But I've got to clear my name
I am a fugitive
Being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive
But I've got to clear my name
Title :  Chains Of Misery 


There's a madman in the corner of your eye
He likes to pry into your sunlight
He wants to burst into the street with you and I
A world of shadows and of rain

He's seen what love is
He wants to pay you back with guilt

He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery, yeah
He's got your chains of misery

There's a prophet in the gutter in the street
He says you're damned and you believe him
He's got a vision but it shines out through your eyes
A world of hatred and fear

He's felt what love means
He wants to pay you back with pain

He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery

He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery

It's only love that holds the key
To your heart
It's only love

He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery

He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery
Title :  The Apparition 


Now I'm here, can you see me?
'Cause I'm out on my own
When the room goes cold
Tell me you can feel me, 'cause I'm here

Here I am, can you see me?
Passing through, on my way
To a place I'd been to
Only in my dreams before

In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
'Cause you can count your real true friends on one hand
Through life

There are those that deceive you
There are those that'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would die for you?
Thought not

Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
So they say

In a world of confusion
People never say what they mean
If you want a straight answer
Go look for one, right now

In a rooms full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall?
Do you sometimes feel like you're on the outside
Looking in?

You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power if you want to
It's true

You can do what you want to
If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way
It does

Are we here for a reason?
I'd like to know just what you think
It would be nice to know what happened
When we die, wouldn't it?

There are some who're wise
There are some who are born naïve
I believe that there are some
That must have lived before, don't you?

As for me, well, I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But I hope that my life's not
An open and shut case

Extra sensory perception
Life after death, telepathy
Can the soul live on
And travel through space and time?

You know I feel so elated
'Cause I'm about to find it out
And when I know all the answers
Maybe then I'll come back
To fill you in

You, don't be alarmed now
If I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around
It's me

And don't disbelieve it
No matter what your friends might say
We'll meet up again some place some way
One day
Title :  Judas Be My Guide 


Lights out, we live in a world of darkness
No doubt, everything's up for sale
We sleep, all of the world is burning
We pray to God for a better deal

Nothing is sacred
Back then or now
Everything's wasted
Is that all there is? Can I go now?

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide

Fight wars, die in a blaze of glory
Come home, meat in a plastic sack
Fall down, pray to your God for mercy
So kneel and help the blade cut clean

Nothing's sacred
Back then or now
Everyone's wasted
Is that all there is? Is that it now?

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide
Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide

I live in the black
I have no guiding light
I whisper in your dreams

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide
Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide
Title :  Weekend Warrior 


The rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool
Who are you kidding being that cool?
Trying to break away from running with the pack
But they ain't listening so you've gotta go back

You're a weekend warrior
When you're one of the crowd
But it's over
Just look at you now
Look at you now
Just look at you now
Just look at you now

You're not so brave the way you behave
It makes you sick, gotta get out quick
It's all bravado when you're out with your mates
It's like a different person goes through those gates

And the game begins
The adrenalin's high
Feel the tension
Maybe someone will die
Someone will die
Someone will die
Maybe someone will die

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior, maybe you ain't that way anymore
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior, maybe you ain't that way anymore

You've gotta get out, gotta get away
But you're in with a clique it's not easy to stray
You've gotta admit you're just living a lie
It didn't take long to work out why

It's hard to say why you got involved
Just wanting to be part
Just wanting to belong
To belong
To belong
To belong, yeah

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior, baby, you ain't that way anymore
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior, maybe you ain't that way anymore

Some of the things that you've done you feel so ashamed
After all it's only a game, isn't it?
And after all the adrenalin's gone
What you gonna do on Monday?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
On Monday

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you were never like that at all
Title :  Fear Of The Dark 


I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks alone
Title :  From Here To Eternity 


She fell in love with his greasy machine
She leaned over, wiped his kick start clean
She'd never seen the Beast before
But she left there wanting more, more, more

But when she was walking on down the road
She heard a sound that made her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back
"I'll take you on a ride from here to eternity"

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

She must be having one of her crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
It made her feel like she's on cloud nine
She even thought she heard the engine sigh

But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the Devil's bend
The Beast and Charlotte, they were two of a kind
They'd always take the line from here to eternity

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

Yes, ah, yeah, like ah
Gentlemen, start your engines
Mr. Murray

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

Hell ain't a bad place, come on
Hell is from here to eternity

"Get on your M11, get on your bikes!"

Title :  I Can't See My Feelings 


I can't see my feelings
Open my eyes
I can't see my feelings
Up in the pale moonlight

I can't see my feelings
Keeping me high
I just keep on reeling
Honey please tell me why

I can't stand there dreaming
All of the time
Music sends a feeling
Up in the pale moonlight
Title :  Roll Over Vic Vella 


...well.

Oh yeah?

Went down ten feet, got a JCB from the road 'cause my other one wouldn't reach. Dug it out... after ten or fifteen minutes he went back to the hole to check the height... full of water! Must have come from the river, eh?

Dunno...someone must have pissed in it.

Say well, fucking big piss... somebody did.

Something you were doing down the

Trying to feed it through the ground, it's like a well. About three feet deep So I....that's right, fucking John shit himself. There was soil, it's like quicksand.... he went down there to spread the fucking soil, and he's sinking in, isn't he. He suddenly reached for the fucking fork lift and I lifted up he couldn't reach it... he was shitting himself. He was just going by the at the end of the boots. He said, "I'm fucking going, I'm going! Just lower the fucking forklift quick!" And he grabbed hold of it, so I had to lift it up with him hanging on the end of it. Good job he didn't let go otherwise right in the fucking mud!

Gonna write a little letter, gonna mail it to my local MP
He's a Maltese man and he's mowing the lawn my way
Roll over Vic Vella, give me more bales of hay

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella
Roll over Vic Vella, don't you mow that lawn my way

Early in the morning I'm giving you a warning

Don't you step on my tractor blades
Hey devil he's on the fiddle
and he ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Vic Vella, tell the tax man the bad news

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella
Roll over Vic Vella, don't you tell the tax man the news

You want to buy a truck and need a new VCR

Roll over Vic Vella, I see that panda-car

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella
Roll over Vic Vella, don't you play those games with me

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella
Roll over Vic Vella, don't you play those games with me

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella
Roll over Vic Vella, don't you play that game with me
Title :  No Prayer For The Dying (Live) 


There are times when I've wondered
And times when I've cried
When my prayers, they were answered
At times when I've lied
But if you asked me a question
Would I tell you the truth?
Now there's something to bet on
You've got nothing to lose, yeah

When I've sat by the window
And gazed at the rain
With an ache in my heart
But never feeling the pain
And if you would tell me
Just what my life means
Walking a long road
Never reaching the end

God, give me the answer to my life
God, give me the answer to my dreams
God, give me the answer to my prayers
God, give me the answer to my being
Title :  Public Enema Number One (Live) 


Ah ha!

When it all comes down the line
And the lights, they turn to greed
And you race off with your tyres screaming
Rolling thunder
And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got one last bullet
One way ticket out of here

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

In the cities, in the streets
There's a tension you can feel
The breaking strain is fast approaching
Guns and riots
The politicians gamble
And lie to save their skins
And the press get fed their scapegoats
Public enema number one

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell you
Your children have more brains
Than your drug infested remains
California dreaming as the earth dies screaming

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
Mm, what ho!
Title :  Sign Of The Cross 


Eleven saintly shrouded men
Silhouettes stand against the sky
One in front with a cross held high
Come to wash my sins away

Standing alone in the wind and rain
Feeling the fear that is growing
Sensing the change in the tide again
Brought by the storm that is brewing
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
Some of the doubt in the things you believe
Now that your faith will be put to the test
Nothing to do but await what is coming

Why then is God still protecting me
Even when I don't deserve it?
Though I am blessed with an inner strength
Some, they would call it a penance
Why am I meant to face this alone?
Asking the question time and again
Praying to God won't keep me alive
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise

They'll be saying their prayers when the moment comes
There'll be penance to pay when it's judgement day
And the guilty'll bleed when the moment comes
They'll be coming to claim, take your soul away

The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross

They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame
They'll be bringing us all immortality
Holding communion so the world be blessed
My creator, my God, lay my soul to rest

The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
The sign of the cross

Lost the love of heaven above
Chose the lust of the earth below
Eleven saintly shrouded men
Came to wash my sins away
Title :  Lord Of The Flies 


I don't care for this world anymore
I just want to live my own fantasy
Fate has brought us to these shores
What was meant to be is now happening

I've found that I like this living in danger
Living on edge it feels... it makes us feel as one
Who cares now what's right or wrong it's reality
Killing so we survive wherever we may roam
Wherever we may hide we've got to get away

I don't want existence to end
We must prepare ourselves for the elements
I just want to feel like we're strong
We don't need a code of morality

I like all the mixed emotion and anger
It brings out the animal the power you can feel
And feeling so high with this much adrenalin
Excited but scary to believe what we've become

Saints and sinners
Something within us
We are lord of the flies
Saints and sinners
Something willing us
To be lord of the flies

Saints and sinners
Something within us
We are lord of the flies
Saints and sinners
Something willing us
To be lord of the flies

Saints and sinners
Something within us
We are lord of the flies
Saints and sinners
Something willing us
To be lord of the flies
Title :  Man On The Edge 


The freeway is jammed
And it's backed up for miles
The car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be
What we deserve we just don't get you see

A briefcase, a lunch and a man on the edge
Each step gets closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven? Are they looking down?
Cause nothing is fair just you look around

Falling down
Falling down
Falling down

He's sick of waiting of lying like this
There's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss
Branded a leper because you don't fit
In the land of the free
You just live by your wits

Once he built missiles a nations defence
Now he can't even give birthday presents
Across the city he leaves in his wake
A glimpse of the future a cannibal state

Falling down
Falling down
Falling down

The freeway is jammed
And it's backed up for miles
The car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be
What we deserve we just don't get you see

A briefcase, a lunch and a man on the edge
Each step gets closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven? Are they looking down?
Cause nothing is fair just you look around

Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Title :  Fortunes Of War 


After the war and now
That they've sent us homeward
I can't help but feel that I'm on my own
No-one can see just what this conflict
Has done to the minds of the men
Who are on their way home

I'm scarred for life
But it's not my flesh that's wounded
So how can I face the torment alone?
The vivid scenes
And all the recurring nightmares
I lay there and sweat until it gets light

People say "don't worry"
Say that time's a perfect healer
That the nightmares, they will come to pass
Can't hear what they're saying
I am living in my own world
And I'm feeling trance-like all the time

I hear voices in my head
Could I really be going crazy?
In the night, the visions seem so real
Do you care if you live or die?
When you laugh, are you really crying?
You're not sure what's real anymore

Fortunes of war, fortunes of war
Fortunes of war, no pain anymore
Fortunes of war, fortunes of war
Fortunes of war, no pain anymore
Fortunes of war

Fortunes of war, fortunes of war
Fortunes of war, no pain anymore
Fortunes of war

Fortunes of war, fortunes of war
Fortunes of war, no pain anymore
Fortunes of war, fortunes of war
Fortunes of war, no pain anymore
Fortunes of war

Sometimes I wake
I feel that my spirit's broken
I wonder if I've the strength to carry on
Carry on
Title :  Look For The Truth 


All my dark dreams drift like smoke in the breeze
The fear grips me as I fall towards my sleep
Here comes the nightmare that never ends
Here is the dream that makes monsters of men

In the house of my soul
In rooms of ugliness and cold
Memories locked away
All the doubts and fears I never faced

Now they come again
I am falling down to meet with them
Fears within us all
Mine awake and they stand up tall

Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through

I pray my sleep will break
Maybe this time I won't wake
Weakness I hide so well
This dagger in my mind will tell

It's my final stand
I make a fist out of each hand
To shadows of the past
Take a breath and I scream, "Attack!"

Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through

Here is the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through
Title :  The Aftermath 


Silently to silence fall
In the fields of futile war
Toys of death are spitting lead
Where boys that were our soldiers bled

War horse and war machine
Curse the name of liberty
Marching on as if they should
Mix in the dirt our brothers' blood

In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for?
Is it worth the pain?
Is it worth dying for?
Who will take the blame?
Why did they make a war?
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all?

Once a ploughman hitches his team
Here he sowed?
His little dream
Now bodies, arms and legs are strewn
Where mustard gas and barbwire bloom
Each moment's like a year
I've nothing left inside for tears
Comrades dead or dying, lie
I'm left alone asking why

In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for?
Is it worth the pain?
Is it worth dying for?
Who will take the blame?
Why did they make a war?
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all?

After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?

After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?

War is over and battles are gone
After the war that no one has won
I'm just soldier

After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?

After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?
Title :  Judgement Of Heaven 


A lonely cry for help preaching out for help to anyone
A silent prayer to God to help you on your way
I've been depressed so long
It's hard to remember when I was happy
I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more
But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way
The hardest part is to get on with your life

You're searching in the dark
Clutching at straws to find a way
You take the tarot cards and throw them to the wind

You question your beliefs
Your inner thoughts, your whole existence
And if there is a god, then answer if you will
And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place
Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace

If you could live your life again
Would you change a thing or leave it all the same?
If you had the chance again
Would you change the thing at all?
When you look back at your past
Can you say that you are proud of what you've done?
Are there times when you believe
That the right you thought was wrong?

All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me
All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me

Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me

All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me
All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me

All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me
All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me

Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Title :  Blood On The World's Hands 


Sometimes it makes me wonder
Sometimes it makes me question
Sometimes it makes me saddened
Always it makes me angry
But when you can see it happening
Madness that's all around you
Nobody seems to worry
The world seems so powerless to act

It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
Each day a new toll

Another assassination
The same day a new creation
But what are they coming into?
Security of a world that brings
One day another killing
Somewhere there's someone starving
Another a savage raping
Meanwhile there's someone laughing at us

It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
Each day it goes on

Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands

Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands

Brutality and aggression
Tomorrow another lesson
Expecting another air raid
Praying for a ceasefire
They say things are getting better
No need to be complacent
There's chaos across the border
And one day it could be happening to us

It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
It's our epitaph
It's out of control
Someone should know
Blood on the world's hands
Someone should
Title :  The Edge Of Darkness 


I've looked into the heart of darkness
Where the blood-red journey ends
When you've faced the heart of darkness
Even your soul begins to bend

For a week I have been waiting
Still I am only in Saigon
The walls move in a little closer
I feel the jungle call me on

Every minute I get weaker
While in the jungle they grow strong
What I wanted was a mission
And for my sins they gave me one

They brought it up just like room service
'Cause everyone gets what they want
And when that mission was all over
I'd never want another one

I know, captain, that you've done this work before
We've got a problem, you can help us all I'm sure
The colonel's gone rogue and his methods are unsound
You'll take a PBR upriver, track him down

There's a conflict in every human heart
And the temptation is to take it all too far
In this war, things get so confused
But there are some things which cannot be excused

He's acting like a god, an insane lunatic
Your mission, terminate with extreme prejudice
The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow
Here is the file and it's all you need to know

Oh
Oh

Here I am, the knife in my hand
And now I understand why the genius must die

Now I stand alone in the darkness
With his blood upon my hands
Where sat the warrior, the poet
Now lie the fragments of a man

I've looked into the heart of darkness
Where the blood-red journey ends
When you've faced the heart of darkness
Even your soul begins to bend

I've looked into the heart of darkness
Title :  2 A.M. 


I get in from work at 2 AM and sit down with a beer
Turn on late night TV and then I wonder why I am here
It's meaningless and trivial and it washes over me
And once again I wonder, "Is this all there is for me?"

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own

Life seems so pathetic, I wish I could leave it all behind
This canvas chair, this bed, these walls that fall in on my mind
Hold on for something better that just drags you through the dirt
Do you just let go or carry on and try to take the hurt?

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own

Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own

Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own

Alone again
Alone again
I'm here on my own
Title :  The Unbeliever 


When you start to take a look within
Do you feel at ease with what you see
Do you think you can have peace of mind
And have self belief or be satisfied

Do you think you even like yourself
Or really think you could be someone else
Is there something that you'd rather be
Never thought you'd be, had the chance to see

All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away

Feel the paranoia creeping in
Like a cancer eating at the skin
Do you feel you've lost your self-esteem
And your self respect, what can you expect

All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away
All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away

All my life I've run astray
Let my faith to slip away
All my life I've run astray
Allowed my faith to drift away

Are you scared to look inside your mind
Are you worried just at what you'll find
Do you really want to face the truth
Does it matter now, what have you got to lose

Try to release the anger from within
Forgive yourself a few immortal sins
Do you really care what people think
Are you strong enough to release the guilt

All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away

All my life I've run astray
Let my faith slip away
All my life I've run astray
Allowed my faith to drift away

All my life I've run astray
Let my faith slip away
All my life I've run astray
Allowed my faith to drift away
Title :  Futureal 


I'm running out of my time
I'm running out of breath
And now it's getting to I can't sleep at night
In the day, feel like dead
I'm getting in far too deep
I feel they're closing in
I've got to say that I'm scared
I know they'll win, even so, I'm prepared

Do you believe what you hear?
Can you believe what you see?
Do you believe what you feel?
Can you believe what is real?
Futureal, what is real?
Futureal

Wherever anyone seems to treat me like a freak
It makes me see I'm only one
Who feels that I know what is real
Sometimes it feels like a game of deadly hide and seek
And when you're reading this
Then I will be gone
Maybe then you will see

Do you believe what you hear?
Can you believe what you see?
Do you believe what you feel?
Can you believe what is real?
Futureal, what is real?
Futureal

Do you believe what you hear?
Can you believe what you see?
Do you believe what you feel?
Can you believe what is real?
Futureal, what is real?
Futureal

Futureal, what is real?
Futureal, what is real?
Futureal, what is real?
Futureal
Title :  The Angel And The Gambler 


Roll of the dice
Take a spin of the wheel
Out of your hands now
So how do you feel?
But you're not gonna win
You'd better go back again

Do you feel lucky or do you feel scared?
Take what luck brings and the Devil may care
But you're down on your luck
And what will the next day bring?

Adrift on the ocean
Afloat in a daydream
Or lost in a maze
Or blind in the haze
So what does it matter?
So why don't you answer?
So why did you send an Angel to mend?

Best make decisions, before it's too late
Take all your chances
Take hold of the reins
A roll of the dice
Ahead of the game again

Nothing to lose, but so much to gain
A little danger, it goes without saying
But what do you care?
You're gonna go in the end

Gate open to Heaven is ready and waiting
Or straight down to Hell, can go there as well
I'll suffer my craving
My soul's not worth saving
So why don't you go?
Just leave well alone

Don't you think I'm a saviour?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a saviour?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a saviour?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

There's like a hunger
That knocks on your door
You've had a taste of it
Still you want more
You've made your mistakes
Won't play it the same again

You have been warned but
Still you plunge in
You play high stakes
But there's nothing to win
You've only one life
And so many things to learn

The Angel on one side
The Devil the other
Which path do you take?
Decisions to make
Arrive on the crossroads
You know where you're going
And what if you wait?
It may be too late

Don't you think I'm a saviour?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a saviour?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a saviour?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?
Title :  Lightning Strikes Twice 


I feel the breeze on my face in expectance
Not very long before the storm reaches here
Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again
Feel something strong as the power draws near

Is it the rolling of thunder that scares you?
Is it the clashing of clouds that hold fear?
But all I know as I sit in a corner alone
It takes me back to my childhood again

And as I wait and I look for an answer
To all the things going round in my head
I ask myself, could it be a disaster and when
It's maybe threatening to happen again?

As the ominous light draws near
There's a lone dog howls in the park
All the people hurry inside
As a lightning flash lights dark
The storm is nearly here

Only God will know

You're sitting alone, you watch
As the wind's blowing treetops
And the swaying rusting of leaves
Plenty of time to perceive
As you wait for rain to fall

Only God knows
The whole sky glows

Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice

Only God knows
The whole sky glows

Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
