Ooh\n

Dance Of Death	2003	5	Dance Of Death	Let me tell you a story to chill the bones\nAbout a thing that I saw\nOne night wandering in the everglades\nI'd one drink but no more\nI was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight\nGazing up at the stars\nNot aware of a presence so near to me\nWatching my every move\nFeeling scared and I fell to my knees\nAs something rushed me from the trees\nTook me to an unholy place\nAnd that is where I fell from grace\nThen they summoned me over to join in with them\nTo the dance of the dead\nInto the circle of fire I followed them\nInto the middle I was led\nAs if time had stopped still I was numb with fear\nBut still I wanted to go\nAnd the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me\nAs I walked onto the coals\nAnd I felt I was in a trance\nAnd my spirit was lifted from me\nAnd if only someone had the chance\nTo witness what happened to me\nAnd I danced and I pranced and I sang with them\nAll had death in their eyes\nLifeless figures they were undead all of them\nThey had ascended from hell\nAs I danced with the dead\nMy free spirit was laughing and howling down at me\nBelow my undead body\nJust danced the circle of dead\nUntil the time came to reunite us both\nMy spirit came back down to me\nI didn't know if I was alive or dead\nAs the others all joined in with me\nBy luck then a skirmish started\nAnd took the attention away from me\nWhen they took their gaze from me\nWas the moment that I fled\nI ran like hell faster than the wind\nBut behind I did not glance\nOne thing that I did not dare\nWas to look just straight ahead\nWhen you know that your time has come around\nYou know you'll be prepared for it\nSay your last goodbyes to everyone\nDrink and say a prayer for it\nWhen you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed\nAnd you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead\nWhen you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed\nAnd you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead\nTo this day I guess I'll never know\nJust why they let me go\nBut I'll never go dancing no more\n'Til I dance with the dead\n
