The Dethalbum	2007	1	Murmaider	There are no fingerprints deep under water, nothing to tie one to a crime.\nAnd if you seek vengeance, all you need are instruments of pain.\nYou need your:\nKnives? Check.\nRope? Check.\nDagger? Check.\nChains? Check.\nLocks? Check.\nLaser Beams? Check.\nAcid? Check.\nBody Bag? Check.\nMurmaider\nBut beware!\nFor when you quench your blood thirst, others will seek their vengeance on you, and they won't rest until you're dead.\nThey'll have their:\nShiv? Check.\nPipe? Check.\nHammer? Check.\nAxe? Check.\nSubject? Check.\nLocation? Check.\nDesire? Check.\nVengeance? Check.\nHold your breath, swim and strain - the smell of death, can't escape.\nBlood will cloud and drift away, attract the murders of mermaids\nIt's so cold, they don't know what you've done, you can't run.\nVengeance is the law for thee, thousand leagues below the sea.\nYou've been tracked, you've been seen murdering the next of kin.\nIn their homes (you) drank their blood, wash your face in blackened blood.\nNow you swim, try to hide, heart beats faster from inside.\nThought it was a big charade, your life was ended by mermaids\nMermaider\nSwords? Check.\nSaws? Check.\nClubs? Check.\nClaws? Check.\nHatred? Check.\nAnger? Check.\nMermaid? Check.\nMurder? Check.\nMURDER! MURDER! MERMAID! MURDER!\nYour life was ended by mermaids.\n
The Dethalbum	2007	2	Go Into The Water	We call out to the beasts of the sea to come forth and join us, this night is yours\nBecause, one day we will all be with you in the black and deep\nOne day we will all go into the water\nGo into the water\nlive there die there\nlive there die\nWe reject our earthly fires\nGone are days of land empires\nLungs transform to take in water\nCloaked in scales we swim and swim on\nWe are alive, and we'll metamorphasize\nAnd we'll sink as we devolve back to beasts\nOur home is down here, and we've known this for years\nWe must conquer from the sea, we build an army with water steeds\nWe'll rise, from our depths down below\nRelease yourselves, drown with me\nWe will conquer land with water\nGone are days of land empires\nLungs transform to take in water\nCloaked in scales we swim and swim on\nWe swim on\nWe swim on\n
The Dethalbum	2007	3	Awaken	Mustakrakish,\nMustakrakish.\nThe time has come to awaken him\nI call upon the ancient lords of the underworld to bring forth this beast and,\nAwaken, awaken, awaken, awaken,\nTake the land that must be taken.\nAwaken, awaken, awaken, awaken,\nDevour worlds, smite, forsaken.\nRise up from your thousandth year of sleep,\nBring forth from your grave, eternally.\nI command you to rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise\nI am the conjuror of demons,\nI'm the father of your death,\nI bring forth the ancient evil,\nI control his every breath,\nI instigate your misfortune,\nWith the birth of killing trolls,\nI awaken Armageddon,\nFeeding on a thousand souls,\nAwaken\nMustakrakish, Musta\nAwaken, awaken, awaken, awaken,\nTake the land that must be taken.\nAwaken, awaken, awaken, awaken,\nDevour worlds, smite, forsaken.\nRise up from your thousandth year of sleep,\nBring forth from your grave eternally.\nDrink will die and land will all be burned\nMustakrakish, king and gate to worlds\nI command you to rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise and,\nAwaken.\n
The Dethalbum	2007	4	Bloodrocuted	You've been targeted in the night\nby violent mercenaries.\nYour identity's been confused\nwith one that looks like you\nYou're a simple man living life.\nYou are an electrician.\nBut there's a bounty on your head\nA billion unmarked travelers checks.\nRUN\nFind your way deep into the woods.\nThe dogs can smell your path.\nTry to find a way out of this.\nThere seems to be no chance.\nBounty hunters closer to you.\nStart to remember back.\nWhen you studied biology\nback in your high school class.\nWait now, what did they say\nabout the human body and proportions of things?\nBlood is an energy conductor.\nI am full of that all I need is an outlet.\nThey're getting closer\nbut now you have a plan.\nLead them to the generator\nwhere there's solid land.\nThe concrete floor will do just fine\nand electric outlets.\nOpen up your veins and splash the blood\nand hit the power lines.\nBloodrocuted\nBloodrocuted\nYou'll be bloodrocuted\nYou'll be bloodrocuted\nYou'll be bloodrocuted right now\nEnemies stand dead in your blood\nThe stench of cooking skin.\nAll of them with their hair on end\nTheir eyes exploded in.\nYou stand with your arms bleeding still\nYou cannot stop the flow.\nThough you are the victor tonight\nyour time has come to go.\ngo go go go go go\nYour time has come to go\ngo go go go go go\nYour time has come to go\nWait now, what did they say\nabout the human body and proportions of things?\nBlood is an energy conductor.\nI am full of that all I need is an outlet.\nBloodrocuted\n

The Dethalbum	2007	8	The Lost Vikings	Riding, and riding, we search across the land\nThe snow, and wind, has frozen the hearts of man\nBut we ride\nWe ride\nMany days ago we left our home\nWith swords to ride into the night\nFighting side by side to destroy our foes\nAnd leave them without life\nWe stop, consider the land that we travelled\nOur map's at home, direction unravelled\nBut we ride\nWe ride\nMany days ago we left our homes,\nWith swords to ride into the night\nFighting side by side to destroy our foes\nAnd leave them without life\nSo much time has passed since we left our land\nThat we've become concerned\nAnd we'll never find the battle\nThat we should have fought and won\nBut we won't stop searching\nLost but still we ride\nSearch until we die\nWe ride\nWe ride\nHungry and tired the frigid plain yields little\nWe trudge on further, eating pride and snow that's brittle\nWe ride\nWe ride\nWe come upon a witch who takes us in\nTo let us share her mighty fire\nShe asks of us our story and we lie and say\nWe ride around for hire\nShe asks us if we'd like to have her map\nAnd points us in some direction\nBut we are far too proud and strong so we keep silent\nAnd ignore her suggestion\nLost but still we ride\nSearch until we die\nAll the fault of pride\nThe gods weep in the night\nLost but still we ride\nSearch until we die\nAll the fault of pride\nThe gods weep in the night\nWe ride\nWe ride\n
