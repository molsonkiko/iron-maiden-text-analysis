hear the rime of the ancient mariner see his eye as he stops one of three mesmerises one of the wedding guests stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea and the music plays on, as the bride passes by caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale driven south to the land of the snow and ice to a place where nobody's been through the snow fog flies on the albatross hailed in god's name, hoping good luck it brings and the ship sails on, back to the north through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on the mariner kills the bird of good omen his shipmates cry against what he's done but when the fog clears, they justify him and make themselves a part of the crime sailing on and on and north across the sea sailing on and on and north 'till all is calm the albatross begins with its vengeance a terrible curse a thirst has begun his shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner about his neck, the dead bird is hung and the curse goes on and on and on at sea and the thirst goes on and on for them and me "day after day, day after day, we stuck nor breath nor motion as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean water, water everywhere and all the boards did shrink water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink" there, calls the mariner there comes a ship over the line but how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide see onward she comes onwards she nears, out of the sun see she has no crew she has no life, wait but there's two death and she life in death, they throw their dice for the crew she wins the mariner and he belongs to her now then  crew one by one they drop down dead, two hundred men she she, life in death she lets him live, her chosen one "one after one by the star dogged moon, too quick for groan or sigh each turned his face with a ghastly pang and cursed me with his eye four times fifty living men (and i heard nor sigh nor groan), with heavy thump, a lifeless lump, they dropped down one by one" the curse it lives on in their eyes the mariner he wished he'd die along with the sea creatures but they lived on, so did he and by the light of the moon he prays for their beauty not doom with heart he blesses them god's creatures all of them too then the spell starts to break the albatross falls from his neck sinks down like lead into the sea then down in falls comes the rain hear the groans of the long dead seamen see them stir and they start to rise bodies lifted by good spirits none of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes and revenge is still sought, penance starts again cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on now the curse is finally lifted and the mariner sights his home spirits go from the long dead bodies form their own light and the mariner's left alone and then a boat came sailing towards him it was a joy he could not believe the pilot's boat, his son and the hermit penance of life will fall onto him and the ship it sinks like lead into the sea and the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins the mariner's bound to tell of his story to tell his tale wherever he goes to teach god's word by his own example that we must love all things that god made and the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man and the tale goes on and on and on

let me tell you a story to chill the bones about a thing that i saw one night wandering in the everglades i'd one drink but no more i was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight gazing up at the stars not aware of a presence so near to me watching my every move feeling scared and i fell to my knees as something rushed me from the trees took me to an unholy place and that is where i fell from grace then they summoned me over to join in with them to the dance of the dead into the circle of fire i followed them into the middle i was led as if time had stopped still i was numb with fear but still i wanted to go and the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me as i walked onto the coals and i felt i was in a trance and my spirit was lifted from me and if only someone had the chance to witness what happened to me and i danced and i pranced and i sang with them all had death in their eyes lifeless figures they were undead all of them they had ascended from hell as i danced with the dead my free spirit was laughing and howling down at me below my undead body just danced the circle of dead until the time came to reunite us both my spirit came back down to me i didn't know if i was alive or dead as the others all joined in with me by luck then a skirmish started and took the attention away from me when they took their gaze from me was the moment that i fled i ran like hell faster than the wind but behind i did not glance one thing that i did not dare was to look just straight ahead when you know that your time has come around you know you'll be prepared for it say your last goodbyes to everyone drink and say a prayer for it when you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed and you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead when you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed and you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead to this day i guess i'll never know just why they let me go but i'll never go dancing no more 'til i dance with the dead

across a painted desert lies a train of vagabonds all that's left of what we were it's what we have become once our empires glorious but now the empire's gone the dead gave us the time to live and now our time is done now we are victorious, we've become our slaves a land of hope and glory building graveyards for the brave have you seen the writing on the wall? have you seen that writing? can you see the riders on the storm? can you see them riding? can you see them riding? holding on to fury is that all we ever know ignorance our judge and jury all we've got to show from hollywood to babylon ~ holy war to kingdom come on a trail of dust and ashes ~ when the burning sky is done a tide of change is coming and that is what you fear the earthquake is a coming but you don't want to hear you're just too blind to see have you seen the writing on the wall? have you seen that writing? can you see the riders on the storm? can you see them riding? can you see them riding, riding next to you? have you seen the writing on the wall? have you seen that writing? can you see the riders on the storm? can you see them riding? have you seen the writing on the wall? have you seen that writing? can you see the riders on the storm? can you see them riding? can you see them riding, riding next to you? 
all is not it seems to be on the outside sometimes what appears to be is a show what shows in the face is only a mirror we all have some better places to go we don't know just what we have 'til we've lost it until that time comes and know that it's gone so hard to say things that we should have uttered long ago tear myself away from thoughts in my head the people worshiping the sun and all the children point up to the sky they see the eagle as it floats on the wind and they follow with their spirits high buffalo roam on the plain we walk in to the flames but dance for rain the hallowed dead in sacred ground and the elders and we wash away their sins for them feel the spirits of the old ones standing proud upon their race and the testament to ancestors ~ that are never to retrace burn the flame of innocence ~ as they ride into the sun thinking now of our forefathers that are lying dead upon holy ground and sacred earth now revisit stolen youth lost in a lost world buried on sacred ground lost in a lost world lying on sacred ground lost in a lost world buried on sacred ground lost in a lost world lying on sacred ground lost in a lost world standing on sacred ground lost in a lost world lying on sacred ground will we ever heal our old wounds like forever darkness worn fighting for their lives again so come on now don't be afraid this is where destiny lies just to let us breathe again put upon this earth to wander and to walk ~ forever lost with the ashes of our enemies to live among our ghosts of our past fear nothing life is but a better path to joy nowhere to go nowhere to run our whole nation overrun itself existence under threat and soon will be none of us left remember names of all our dead now in enemies that fled reaching for our sky forever free a sadness that is proud as the clouds all drift away now until we meet again
